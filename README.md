UCI-HAR-Data
============

Getting &amp; Cleaning Data Course: Project data anlaysis repo  

This repository contains:  
1. the R script (run_analysis.R) to generate the tidy data set (tidydata.txt).  
2. the codebook (UCI HAR Data Codebook.md) to describe the tidydata.txt file.  
3. a sample copy of the 'tidydata.txt' output. In the 'all' directory.   
4. this README.md file.  

The following code will read the tidydata.txt file if it is copied to your working directory
```
td <- read.table("tidydata.txt", header = TRUE)
```
or, you can read direct from the url.... (not 100% sure if this direct link works without a password)
```
td <- read.table("https://github.com/JimboDimbo/UCI-HAR-Data/raw/master/all/tidydata.txt", header = TRUE)
```

The course project is to take the UCI HAR Data set  (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
and combine/summarise the 'train' and 'test' data sets into one output table (tidydata.txt).
  
The output data set can be reproduced by copying the run_analysis.R script into a directory which has the UCI data extracted. After unzipping that data it will create 'train' and 'test' folders.
To run the script, you need the R programming language installed, v3 or later and the dplyr package.
The script file should be editied to change the 'mainDir' variable to the local UCI data directory.
When the script is run, it will create a new directory 'all' and place the tidydata.txt summary output file into it.

The file 'features_info.txt' in the UCI HAR Data set is the code book supplied.

```
td <- read.table("tidydata.txt", header = TRUE)
```
is enough to read the tidydata.txt file if you copy it to your working directory: > getwd(); dir()
